Fileupdate app

This app is intended to be used by a system that replicates part of its database to another system that can be used as a contingency authorizer.
The app is made available by the other system (the contingency authorizer) and receives bulk put ("upsert") and delete requests.
A get request by id (pan) is also provided.
